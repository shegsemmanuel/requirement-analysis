# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
The Requirement Analysis focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?‚Äù
Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
Requirement Gathering:  is the foundational process of identifying and documenting the needs and desires of stakeholders (like customers, users, and clients) to define what a project or product should achieve.

Requirement Elicitation: the process of discovering, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs, wants, and constraints of stakeholders for a proposed system or product.

Requirement Documentaion: is a formal, written description of the attributes, capabilities, characteristics, or qualities a system or product must possess to meet business and user needs

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: is a crucial software development process that involves understanding and documenting stakeholder needs (analysis) and then representing these needs visually (modeling) to create a clear blueprint for the system to be built.

Requirement validation: is the process of confirming that a set of requirements for a system or product accurately reflects the true needs and expectations of the stakeholders, ensuring they are complete, consistent, and align with the customer's goals rather than just checking if they are written correctly..

#  Types of Requirementsts 
# Functional Requirement
specify what a system should do, outlining the features, tasks, and operations it must perform for users and stakeholders. example

E-commerce Site:
The system must allow users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete a secure checkout process using major credit cards. 

Online Banking:
Users should be able to log in with their username and password and view their account balance. 

# Non Functional Requirements
specify the quality attributes and operational constraints of a system, defining how the system should perform rather than what specific functions it performs. example

Performance: The system must load a page within 3 seconds. 
Security: The system must encrypt user data to prevent unauthorized access. 
Usability: The system must be intuitive and easy for new users to navigate. 
Reliability: The system should have 99.9% uptime.
